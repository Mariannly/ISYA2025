## Course 2: Compact Objects
###  Ignacio Francisco Ranea Sandoval (Universidad Naciona de La Plata - Argentina), 5 lectures

#### Abstract: 
Compact objects are the end stage of the evolution of high-mass stars. Their extreme nature makes them excellent to test both general relativity and nuclear physics. The last few decades and particularly the last five have been a revolution for this area and we have been able to obtain increasing quality and amount of astronomical data. This information allows us to put stringent constraints on the nature of the sources and in this way understand more in detail the matter content and properties. This can be performed mainly due to the adveniment of multi-messenger astrophysics including gravitational waves. During these lectures we will learn about observational and theoretical properties of both neutron stars and black holes. We will put special attention into the behavior of matter inside neutron stars and particularly study the possibility of a hadron-quark phase transition taking place in the most internal part of such compact stars. Moreover, we will study the quasinormal modes of these objects as non-radial oscillations could lead to gravitational-wave emission from isolated compact objects. We will introduce the concept of universal relationships associated with these modes and their astrophysical applications.
