## Study of the Starobinsky Inflationary Model
### Clara Rojas (Universidad Yachay Tech)
In this work we study the scalar and tensor power spectra for the Starobinsky inflationary model using the phase integral and the uniform approximation method. We show that the these methods reproduce the observables with a good accuracy, the value of the scalar spectral $n_S$ and the value of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ compares favorably with observations. Also, we compare our results with the second-order slow-roll approximation.


## Exploring the Giants: The Role of Supermassive Black Holes in Shaping Galaxy Evolution
### Silvana Delgado Andrade (Texas A&M University)

Abstract: Understanding galaxy formation and evolution across cosmic time is one of the central challenges in modern astrophysics. Within the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM) paradigm, galaxies assemble hierarchically through minor and major mergers, fundamentally shaping their morphology, stellar structure, and internal kinematics. Central to these processes are supermassive black holes (SMBHs), which play a pivotal role through feedback mechanisms and energetic outflows, influencing star formation and shaping their host galaxies into massive, quiescent systems.

Integral field spectroscopy has revolutionized our ability to study galaxies by mapping stellar motions in unprecedented detail, thus revealing their intrinsic shapes, mass distributions, and dark matter content. I will introduce stellar kinematic modeling techniques, including Jeans anisotropic models and Schwarzschild orbit-superposition models, demonstrating how these methods enable precise measurement of SMBH masses and help us understand their interplay with baryonic matter and dark matter halos. Finally, I will discuss recent advances in connecting stellar dynamical properties of nearby galaxies with their high-redshift progenitors, emphasizing the critical role of SMBHs in galaxy evolution.

## Stellar models with like-Wyman IIa complexity factor
### David Andrade (Universidad Yachay Tech)

The goal of this work is to build a new family of stellar interior solutions in the anisotropic regime of pressure using the framework of gravitational decoupling via minimal geometric deformation. For such purpose, we use a generalization of the complexity factor of the well-known Wyman IIa (n = 1) interior solution in order to close the Einstein’s Field Equations, as well we use the Wyman IIa, Tolman IV, and Heintzmann IIa and Durgapal IV models as seeds solutions. These models fulfill the fundamental physical acceptability conditions for the compactness factor of the system 4U 1820-30. Stability against convection and against collapse are also studied.
