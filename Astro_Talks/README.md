# Astro Talks (Wednesday 23 July 2025)

## Morning Session (10h00 - 11h30):

## 1. Study of the Starobinsky Inflationary Model
### Clara Rojas (Universidad Yachay Tech)
In this work we study the scalar and tensor power spectra for the Starobinsky inflationary model using the phase integral and the uniform approximation method. We show that the these methods reproduce the observables with a good accuracy, the value of the scalar spectral $n_S$ and the value of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ compares favorably with observations. Also, we compare our results with the second-order slow-roll approximation.


## 2. Exploring the Giants: The Role of Supermassive Black Holes in Shaping Galaxy Evolution
### Silvana Delgado Andrade (Texas A&M University, USA)

Abstract: Understanding galaxy formation and evolution across cosmic time is one of the central challenges in modern astrophysics. Within the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM) paradigm, galaxies assemble hierarchically through minor and major mergers, fundamentally shaping their morphology, stellar structure, and internal kinematics. Central to these processes are supermassive black holes (SMBHs), which play a pivotal role through feedback mechanisms and energetic outflows, influencing star formation and shaping their host galaxies into massive, quiescent systems.

Integral field spectroscopy has revolutionized our ability to study galaxies by mapping stellar motions in unprecedented detail, thus revealing their intrinsic shapes, mass distributions, and dark matter content. I will introduce stellar kinematic modeling techniques, including Jeans anisotropic models and Schwarzschild orbit-superposition models, demonstrating how these methods enable precise measurement of SMBH masses and help us understand their interplay with baryonic matter and dark matter halos. Finally, I will discuss recent advances in connecting stellar dynamical properties of nearby galaxies with their high-redshift progenitors, emphasizing the critical role of SMBHs in galaxy evolution.

## 3. Tracing the matter by understanding cosmic filaments

### Daniela Galárraga-Espinosa (Kavli IPMU, Japan)
Matter in the Universe is not randomly distributed: it forms a vast, interconnected network of nodes, filaments, walls, and voids known as the cosmic web. While the dense nodes have been extensively studied, cosmic filaments, elongated structures bridging these regions, remain less well understood, despite likely containing more than half of the matter in the Universe today.
In this talk, I will focus on the physical properties of cosmic filaments at z=0 using state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations, and explore their evolution back to z=4. I will highlight the diversity of filament populations and show how these structures are crucial to solve the missing baryons problem in the late Universe. I will conclude with a brief outlook on how upcoming galaxy surveys will transform our ability to detect and understand these important structures.

## Afternoon Session (17h00 - 18h30)::

## 4. Stellar models with like-Wyman IIa complexity factor
### David Andrade (Universidad Yachay Tech, Ecuador)

The goal of this work is to build a new family of stellar interior solutions in the anisotropic regime of pressure using the framework of gravitational decoupling via minimal geometric deformation. For such purpose, we use a generalization of the complexity factor of the well-known Wyman IIa (n = 1) interior solution in order to close the Einstein’s Field Equations, as well we use the Wyman IIa, Tolman IV, and Heintzmann IIa and Durgapal IV models as seeds solutions. These models fulfill the fundamental physical acceptability conditions for the compactness factor of the system 4U 1820-30. Stability against convection and against collapse are also studied.

## 5. Symmetric Cryptography Using Classical Waves - CLAWA
### José Manuel Ramírez (Universidad Yachay Tech)

This paper demonstrates the ability to perform symmetric cryptography with regular, continuous waves. With no knowledge of the time interval of each component, there is no way to carry out cryptanalysis by simple language statistics or known plain-text attacks. A comparison with the Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) modulation is made. The method aims to transmit and compute generic information, not only the transmission of 0s and 1s per se, but frequencies. The proof of concept has been implemented as an application programming interface (API) and can be easily used by several popular programming languages.
